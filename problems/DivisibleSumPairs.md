#Divisible Sum Pairs.

You are given an array of *n* integers, `ar[] = [ar[0], ar[1], ..., a[n-1]]` , 
and a positive integer, *k*. Find and print the number of `(i, j)` pairs where 
`i < j` and `ar[i] + ar[j]` is divisible by *k*.

For example, `ar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and *k* = 5. 
Our three pairs meeting the criteria are `[1, 4]`, `[2, 3]` and `[4, 6]`.
